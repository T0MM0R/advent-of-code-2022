My solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 in Ruby

My goal is to conceptialize the problems as objects and use OOP style programming.  It is not my aim to minimize lines of code at the sacrifice of OOP.  But it is also not my goal to sacrifice performance in the name of OOP structure.  All feedback is welcomed!
